# Advent of Code
## Description
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge's programming 
puzzles.
All the code that is uploaded is as-is after I used it to solve the puzzle.
It may, therefore, not be the most efficient or cleanest code.
## Editions
### 2023
This is the first year I participated in Advent of Code.
I used it as a way to learn more about the STL of C++, as during my courses, we are not (always) allowed to use all 
convenient features of it.

For the first two days, I used two files, one for each part of the challenge.
After that, I decided to use one file per day, as I found that these parts often had a large degree of overlap.

Unfortunately, at this moment, I have not yet found the time to complete all the challenges.
At day 10, the challenges started overlapping with exams.

## Usage
I modify `CMakelists.txt` to point to the correct file for the challenge.

I have set my IDE to automatically forward the content of `test.txt` to the standard input of the program.
This way, I can easily test my code with the provided test cases.
